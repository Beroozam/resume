        I am interested in FrontEnd. And
        in particular, I follow ReactJs
        and NextJs. Clean coding is
        important to me and I try to
        follow its principles.
        I attach special importance to
        training and acquiring skills and
        personal development. And I
        find teamwork more helpful in
        reaching this goal.
